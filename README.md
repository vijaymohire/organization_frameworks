# organization_frameworks
This is for repository of various frameworks related to organisations like the enterprise framework, operations framework etc

Delivery of models, frameworks, Ent Arch doesn't add value. You need to address unique domain and user issues and design products that will become part of a solution that can package partner, 3 party assets, plugins, etc with a major asset by me.

So QA, TRL, PM are mere tools to reach the goal. Code level framework models, Embedded code frameworks, Apps, Web pages, New Server design, parts, tools etc  are to be developed that meet the ORG needs
